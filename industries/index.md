Bamboo Law Group is happy to help anyone, regardless of what industry you work in or whether you are just starting out or have been in business for several years. We are particularly interested in helping clients in the following areas:

## Game Devs
We might have grown up, but we have never grown out of gaming. Helping indie game developers with their business is why we went to law school and became attorneys. It has been really rewarding to fulfill our dream of representing game developers as clients. We can help you in the following ways:
* Structuring your business
  * Protect yourself from personal liability arising from your busienss deals
* Drafting Agreements to protect your business
  * Independent contractor agreements
  * terms of service/privacy policies
  * EULAs
* Protecting your IP
  * DMCA takedowns
  * Cease and Desist Letters and Responses
  * Licensing rights

## eSports
While we still love to play games, we have gotten a lot of joy watching professional athelets play in the last few years and generally watching as eSports has begun to take off. Our reflexes have dulled and we can't own anyone in CS:GO anymore (could we ever?) and we feed just a little too often to be useful in MOBAs (or "Hero Brawlers", if you're Blizzard), so we needed to find another way to get involved in the sport because our dream of ever being good enough to win a tournament has passed. Our new professional gaming dream rests with you, because we would love to represent eSports atheletes and teams in making their dreams of being professional gamers come true.

Whether you are a competitor, caster, or streamer, we can help with:

* Obtaining Professional Athelete/eSports Visas for foreign players
* Reviewing, Negotiating, and Drafting Contracts and Agreements
  * Player Contracts
  * Streaming Contracts
  * Sponsorship Agreements
* Structuring your organization as business to protect your personal assets, and 
* Protecting your IP 
 
Let us help you, so that you can focus on being the best.

## Web Designers and Web Developers
We understand your jobs and position well. Our attorney's father did web design work on the side and even we have dabbled in it ourselves (do you like our jekyll site?). Designers, we can speak your language and understand things like HTML/Haml, CSS/SASS, and jQuery/Javascript (okay, we can only kind of fake our way through javascript). Developers, we are working on polishing our Ruby on Rails skills and developing some side projects of our own. More importantly than being able to chat code with you, we know what legal troubles you might face in running your business.

We can help freelancers and firms with the following: 

* Drafting and Reviewing Contracts
  * Independent Contractor Agreements (Work for Hire)
  * Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Confidentiality Agreements
  * Project Agreements for use with clients
* Business Formation (LLCs)
* Protecting your IP

## Startups
We know that your startup is your life and you might not necessarily have the time, energy, or money to figure out and maintain compliance with all of the legal aspects of your startup. We understand the demands that you are faced with and we want to take the legal side of things off of your plate so that you can focus on making your product or service perfect for your investors and customers. We can help you by drafting contracts that will enforce the deals you make and inform you about the important terms in those agreements with distributors that you don't have time to look over. You know that you need a privacy policy and terms of service that you didn't copy and paste from a competitors website, but you don't think that you have the money to hire someone to draft it. Let us do that and help you whenever something comes up in the future. We know that hiring a law firm is scary and expensive. 

Spend some time talking with us and see if it is a good fit first. We offer free consultations and want to hear about your business and your needs. We are also flexible when it comes to cost and can figure out something that works for your business strategy and income. If you can only afford a little bit of time, we can charge an affordable hourly rate. If you know you have things come up and need to be able to ask someone, we can work off of a block rate. If you just need a single project done, we can quote you a flat amount for that project. Contact us and let us know how we can help. 

## International Businesses/Startups
