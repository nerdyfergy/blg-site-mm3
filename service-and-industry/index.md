# Services

Bamboo Law Group is a law firm in Seattle, Washington, but represents clients from all over the world. We offer affordable legal services in the following areas:

## Drafting, Reviewing, and Negotiating Contracts and Agreements
Disputes in contract law often come about when parties are on the same page - figuratively - so it is best to put the terms of your agreement down on the  page - literally. Oral agreements or hand-shake deals are valid and enforceable contracts, but those agreements are extremely difficult to prove and allow for parties to misremember or misunderstand key terms, which can put you and your business at risk. 

Ensuring a well drafting contract is in place offers you peace of mind and ensures that everyone understands their obligations and requirements. Having a well drafted contract does not need to be expensive and we can help draft contracts and agreements that will keep your business protected and your business relationships healthy.

It is equally important to understand the terms and conditions that you are agreeing to be subject to when you enter an agreement with another party. You know that the terms in a contract someone else is asking you to sign can have real world consequences. You have an opportunity to have someone like us review those terms and explain to you what they mean and how you can be liable if things go wrong. 
Some of the more common types of agreements that our clients have us work on are:
+ Independent Contractor Agreements
⋅⋅* Protect your product and ensure that you own all of your product by using a clearly worded agreement that lays out the roles and responsibilities of each party.
+ Software and Copyright  Licenses and Assignments
⋅⋅* If you are the one receiving the license, then make sure that the agreement covers all of the rights, titles, and interests that you are expecting. If you are the one granting a license or assignment, then make sure that you understand what rights you keep and how you can exercise those rights. 
+ Non-Disclosure Agreements or Confidentiality Agreements
⋅⋅* Depending on your business, this can be one of the most important documents that you have employees, contractors, or business partners sign. It is important to review these documents to find out what can be disclosed, to who, and when, as well as what the possible consequences are if you or one of your agents makes an unauthorized disclosure.

## Forming Your Business
Even if you are a solo developer releasing an app or program for free, there are still benefits to releasing the product under a legally formed business entity. Aside from potential tax benefits, a properly formed and maintained business can protect your personal assets from liability that may arise from releasing your product. 
If you have a team of developers, forming a business is even more important. In addition to tax and liability protections, it also helps you avoid potential disputes between members and makes sure that the rules for how your business will be run and how disputes are resolved are put into writing so that everyone can be on the same page.
