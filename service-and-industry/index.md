# Services

Bamboo Law Group is a law firm in Seattle, Washington, but represents clients from all over the world. We offer affordable legal services in a wide variety of areas for individuals, startups, and small businesses. Some of our more commonly used services include:

## Drafting, Reviewing, and Negotiating Contracts and Agreements
Disputes in contract law often come about when parties are on the same page - figuratively - so it is best to put the terms of your agreement down on the  page - literally. Oral agreements or hand-shake deals are valid and enforceable contracts, but those agreements are extremely difficult to prove and allow for parties to misremember or misunderstand key terms, which can put you and your business at risk. 

Ensuring a well drafting contract is in place offers you peace of mind and ensures that everyone understands their obligations and requirements. Having a well drafted contract does not need to be expensive and we can help draft contracts and agreements that will keep your business protected and your business relationships healthy.

It is equally important to understand the terms and conditions that you are agreeing to be subject to when you enter an agreement with another party. You know that the terms in a contract someone else is asking you to sign can have real world consequences. You have an opportunity to have someone like us review those terms and explain to you what they mean and how you can be liable if things go wrong. 
We work on a wide variety of contracts and agreements for our clients, including official contest and sweepstakes rules, distribution agreements, and leases. Some of the more common types of agreements that our clients have us work on are:
* Independent Contractor Agreements
  * Protect your product and ensure that you own all of your product by using a clearly worded agreement that lays out the roles and responsibilities of each party.
* Software and Copyright  Licenses and Assignments
  * If you are the one receiving the license, then make sure that the agreement covers all of the rights, titles, and interests that you are expecting. If you are the one granting a license or assignment, then make sure that you understand what rights you keep and how you can exercise those rights. 
* Non-Disclosure Agreements or Confidentiality Agreements
  * Depending on your business, this can be one of the most important documents that you have employees, contractors, or business partners sign. It is important to review these documents to find out what can be disclosed, to who, and when, as well as what the possible consequences are if you or one of your agents makes an unauthorized disclosure.

## Forming Your Business
Forming a business is almost always going to be more beneficial in the long run than operating as an unformed entity. The cost of filing and maintaining a formation is relatively low and it can be done relatively quickly. For example, in Washington, it costs $200 and takes 2-5 business days to file an LLC (as of 1/6/2016). The benefits of operating under a formed business entity are huge. Even if you are a solo developer releasing an app or program for free, there are still benefits to releasing the product under a legally formed business entity. Aside from potential tax benefits, a properly formed and maintained business can protect your personal assets from liability that may arise from your business dealings.  

If you have a team of developers, forming a business is even more important. In addition to tax and liability protections, it also helps you avoid potential disputes between members and makes sure that the rules for how your business will be run and how disputes are resolved are put into writing so that everyone can be on the same page.

There are several differnt corporate forms and you should consult with an attorney to know if you are choosing the right form, but generally, you will probably want an LLC as it offers the most flexibility in how the business is structured and run, while still providing limited liability protection.

Depending on your situation (single person business vs. multiple founders/directors) and chosen business structure (LLC vs. Class C Corporation), there may be other expenses and obligations to be aware of. Things like operating agreements, corporate compliance, and by-laws can come into play and it pays to have someone advise you through some of the risks and liabilities.

# Industries

Bamboo Law Group is happy to help anyone, regardless of what industry you work in or whether you are just starting out or have been in business for several years. We are particularly interested in helping clients in the following areas:

## Game Devs
We might have grown up, but we have never grown out of gaming. Helping indie game developers with their business is why we went to law school and became attorneys. It has been really rewarding to fulfill our dream of representing game developers as clients. We can help you in the following ways:
* Structuring your business
  * Protect yourself from personal liability arising from your busienss deals
* Drafting Agreements to protect your business
  * Independent contractor agreements
  * terms of service/privacy policies
  * EULAs
* Protecting your IP
  * DMCA takedowns
  * Cease and Desist Letters and Responses

## Startups
We know that your startup is your life and you might not necessarily have the time, energy, or money to figure out and maintain compliance with all of the legal aspects of your startup. We understand the demands that you are faced with and we want to take the legal side of things off of your plate so that you can focus on making your product or service perfect for your investors and customers. We can help you by drafting contracts that will enforce the deals you make and inform you about the important terms in those agreements with distributors that you don't have time to look over. You know that you need a privacy policy and terms of service that you didn't copy and paste from a competitors website, but you don't think that you have the money to hire someone to draft it. Let us do that and help you whenever something comes up in the future. We know that hiring a law firm is scary and expensive. 

Spend some time talking with us and see if it is a good fit first. We offer free consultations and want to hear about your business and your needs. We are also flexible when it comes to cost and can figure out something that works for your business strategy and income. If you can only afford a little bit of time, we can charge an affordable hourly rate. If you know you have things come up and need to be able to ask someone, we can work off of a block rate. If you just need a single project done, we can quote you a flat amount for that project. Contact us and let us know how we can help. 

## eSports
While we still love to play games, we have gotten a lot of joy watching professional athelets play in the last few years and generally watching as eSports has begun to take off. Our reflexes have dulled and we can't own anyone in CS:GO anymore (could we ever?) and we feed just a little too often to be useful in MOBAs (or "Hero Brawlers", if you're Blizzard), so we needed to find another way to get involved in the sport because our dream of ever being good enough to win a tournament has passed. Our new professional gaming dream rests with you, because we would love to represent eSports atheletes and teams in making your dreams of being professional gamers come true.

We can help with visas, reviewing and negotiating contracts, structuring your team's business to protect your assets, and protecting your IP. That way you can focus on being the best and achieve ~~our~~ your dreams of travelling the world and striving to be the best.
