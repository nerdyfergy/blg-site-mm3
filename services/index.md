## Business Formation
Even if you are a solo developer releasing an app or program for free, there are still benefits to releasing the product under a legally formed business entity. Aside from potential tax benefits, a properly formed and maintained business can protect your personal assets from liability that may arise from releasing your product. 
If you have a team of developers, forming a business is even more important. In addition to tax and liability protections, it also helps you avoid potential disputes between members and makes sure that the rules for how your business will be run and how disputes are resolved are put into writing so that everyone can be on the same page.
