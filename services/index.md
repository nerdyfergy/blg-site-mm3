Bamboo Law Group is a law firm in Seattle, Washington, but represents clients from all over the world. We offer affordable legal services in a wide variety of areas for individuals, startups, and small businesses. Some of our more commonly used services include:

## Drafting, Reviewing, and Negotiating Contracts and Agreements
Disputes in contract law often come about when parties are on the same page - figuratively - so it is best to put the terms of your agreement down on the  page - literally. Oral agreements or hand-shake deals are valid and enforceable contracts, but those agreements are extremely difficult to prove and allow for parties to misremember or misunderstand key terms, which can put you and your business at risk. 

Ensuring a well drafting contract is in place offers you peace of mind and ensures that everyone understands their obligations and requirements. Having a well drafted contract does not need to be expensive and we can help draft contracts and agreements that will keep your business protected and your business relationships healthy.

It is equally important to understand the terms and conditions that you are agreeing to be subject to when you enter an agreement with another party. You know that the terms in a contract someone else is asking you to sign can have real world consequences. You have an opportunity to have someone like us review those terms and explain to you what they mean and how you can be liable if things go wrong. 
We work on a wide variety of contracts and agreements for our clients, including official contest and sweepstakes rules, distribution agreements, and leases. Some of the more common types of agreements that our clients have us work on are:
<ul>Independent Contractor Agreements
  <li> Protect your product and ensure that you own all of your product by using a clearly worded agreement that lays out the roles and responsibilities of each party.</li>
</ul>
* Software and Copyright  Licenses and Assignments
  * If you are the one receiving the license, then make sure that the agreement covers all of the rights, titles, and interests that you are expecting. If you are the one granting a license or assignment, then make sure that you understand what rights you keep and how you can exercise those rights. 
* Non-Disclosure Agreements or Confidentiality Agreements
  * Depending on your business, this can be one of the most important documents that you have employees, contractors, or business partners sign. It is important to review these documents to find out what can be disclosed, to who, and when, as well as what the possible consequences are if you or one of your agents makes an unauthorized disclosure.

## Forming Your Business
Forming a business is almost always going to be more beneficial in the long run than operating as an unformed entity. The cost of filing and maintaining a formation is relatively low and it can be done relatively quickly. For example, in Washington, it costs $200 and takes 2-5 business days to file an LLC (as of 1/6/2016). The benefits of operating under a formed business entity are huge. Even if you are a solo developer releasing an app or program for free, there are still benefits to releasing the product under a legally formed business entity. Aside from potential tax benefits, a properly formed and maintained business can protect your personal assets from liability that may arise from your business dealings.  

If you have a team of developers, forming a business is even more important. In addition to tax and liability protections, it also helps you avoid potential disputes between members and makes sure that the rules for how your business will be run and how disputes are resolved are put into writing so that everyone can be on the same page.

There are several differnt corporate forms and you should consult with an attorney to know if you are choosing the right form, but generally, you will probably want an LLC as it offers the most flexibility in how the business is structured and run, while still providing limited liability protection.

Depending on your situation (single person business vs. multiple founders/directors) and chosen business structure (LLC vs. Class C Corporation), there may be other expenses and obligations to be aware of. Things like operating agreements, corporate compliance, and by-laws can come into play and it pays to have someone advise you through some of the risks and liabilities. 

## Advice and General Counsel Services
We are an experienced in providing general counsel services and are available to assist your company at any time and in any capacity. The cost of an in-house legal team or an attorney on full retainer is expensive and can negate the benefit of having an attorney on staff. We commit to learning the goals of your business and craft legal solutions that fit into the overall mission of your company. We can help with a particular legal question that is bothering you, or provide a thorough review of your business, on either a one-time or an on-going basis.     

We know that you confront complex legal issues every day including intellectual property issues, contract negotiation and drafting,  employment policies or conflicts, and compliance with complex federal and state regulations. We pair our experience and knowledge these areas with an understanding of your particular business needs.  We strive to maximize the value of our legal services, and our attorney will help you identify and prioritize the areas of legal help your business needs.   

Spend some time talking with us and see if it is a good fit first. We offer free consultations and want to hear about your business and your needs. We are also flexible when it comes to cost and can figure out something that works for your business strategy and income. If you can only afford a little bit of time, we can charge an affordable hourly rate. If you know you have things come up and need to be able to ask someone, we can work off of a block rate. If you just need a single project done, we can quote you a flat amount for that project. Contact us and let us know how we can help.
